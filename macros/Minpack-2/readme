This directory contains the MINPACK-2 test problem collection.
This version released 11/12/93.

Subroutines are named by the following convention: The first letter in each
subroutine name dictates arithmetic precision, s for single, d for double.
The second thru fifth letters describe the application, eg. fic denotes
the flow in a channel problem. The sixth and seventh letters denote the 
subroutine action.  

	letters 6 and 7                 action
        ---------------                 ------
              fj          function, Jacobian, initial approximation
              js          Jacobian times vector
              fg          function, gradient, initial approximation
              hs          Hessian times vector
              sp          Jacobian sparsity structure
              bc          Boundary data

The main difference between the 1993 version and the 1992 version 
in tprobs.92 is in execution speed. Character comparisons were replaced
by integer comparisons; this change often leads to improvements
by a factor of 2 or more.
