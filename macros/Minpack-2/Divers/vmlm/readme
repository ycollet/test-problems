           INSTRUCTIONS
          
1. Create the vmlm directory structure with
       gzip -d vmlm.tar.gz
       tar -xvf vmlm.f
   This produces the directory vmlm and 
   subdirectories source, blas, tprobs.

2. Change directories to vmlm and install vmlm with 
       make install
   This creates libraries in each of the subdirectories

3. Create the executable vmlm with 
       make vmlm 
   and run the sample problems by executing vmlm
   The timer in file dtimer.f assumes that elapsed time is 
   given by etime; you may need to modify this file.

4. Compare the output in vmlm.out with the output in vmlm.sun4
